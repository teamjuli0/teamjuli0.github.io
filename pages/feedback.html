            Here you will find a very small portion out of the large pool of
            positive feedback I've recieved during my time as a tutor. I call
            this my wall of honor because it shows the difference one can make
            in others lives while also having the opportunity to grow along side
            them. One of my biggest passions has always been helping others so
            to me this...

I am able to understand the syntax and how the update insert select works! I felt like giving up at this point due to how I was working very long and am now suddenly unemployed and school has just been hard but Julio always gives me courage to keep pushing and keep learning! Just the way he helps me out feels like I am doing great at understanding the concepts, I just need time and practice to get really good!
